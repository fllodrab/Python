The audience is invited to ask questions.</p> <p>Keys says the SEA, which is credited with targeting media organizations from Twitter to <i>The Guardian</i>, is composed of four young students angered by media stories about the conflict in Syria. Reporting by <i>The Verge</i> suggests the group is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/24/4363140/syrian-electronic-army-hackers">closer to eight core members</a>, likely male, aged 18 to 20.</p> <p> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/11/5200832/the-syrian-electronic-army-is-allegedly-conducting-a-live-interview-matthew-keys">Continue reading&hellip;</a> </p> http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/11/5200832/the-syrian-electronic-army-is-allegedly-conducting-a-live-interview-matthew-keys Adrianne Jeffries 2013-12-11T14:23:56-05:00 2013-12-11T14:23:56-05:00 <img alt="" src="http://cdn3.sbnation.com/entry_photo_images/9548077/adm5_large.png" /> <p>In August,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/8/7/4598660/google-begins-rollout-android-device-manager-track-your-lost-phone">Google released Android Device Manager</a>, a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/22/4901932/apple-updates-more-apps-for-ios-7">Find My iPhone</a>-style service for locating and remotely wiping your missing phones and tablets.

Using the app, you can reset your device's lock screen PIN or erase all the data on the phone. There's nothing fancy about the app, but it could come in handy the next time your smartphone goes missing&nbsp;&mdash; and it blunts an advantage that iOS has had over Android since 2010.</p> <p> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/tech/2013/12/11/5200710/android-device-manager-arrives-in-play-store-to-track-missing-gadgets">Continue reading&hellip;</a> </p> http://www.theverge.com/tech/2013/12/11/5200710/android-device-manager-arrives-in-play-store-to-track-missing-gadgets Casey Newton 2013-12-11T14:08:26-05:00 2013-12-11T14:08:26-05:00 <img alt="" src="http://cdn0.sbnation.com/entry_photo_images/9547979/GettyImages_454786231_large.jpg" /> <p><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5196276/president-barack-obama-takes-selfie-at-nelson-mandela-memorial" target="_blank">President Obama's taking a self portrait</a> during the memorial service for Nelson Mandela &mdash; in what many outlets have now termed "selfie-gate" &mdash; may not have deserved all the ire it received. Roberto Schmidt, the AFP photographer who took the now-infamous photo, <a href="http://blogs.afp.com/correspondent/?post%2FSelfie#.UqhYPjuLhyU.twitter" target="_blank">remarks on the AFP blog</a> that, given the relaxed atmosphere at the service, he had nothing to complain about.

At first, they were only available for Chrome OS and the Chrome browser for Windows, but now Mac users can try these apps out. When installing a full Chrome App, a new app launcher is added to your dock &mdash; it resembles&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/5/21/4351358/google-planning-to-bring-chrome-app-launcher-to-os-x">the app launcher in Chrome OS</a> and differentiates between web links (for tools like Gmail, Google Play Music, and other traditional Chrome browser apps) and full Chrome Apps.</p> <p>While many of these new Chrome Apps still largely resemble their web counterparts (the Pocket app, for...</p> <p> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/11/5200680/google-brings-its-desktop-style-chrome-apps-to-the-mac">Continue reading&hellip;</a> </p> http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/11/5200680/google-brings-its-desktop-style-chrome-apps-to-the-mac Nathan Ingraham 2013-12-11T13:40:55-05:00 2013-12-11T13:40:55-05:00 <img alt="" src="http://cdn1.sbnation.com/entry_photo_images/9547733/google-logo-stock1_2040_large.jpg" /> <p>Google is&nbsp;<a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2013/12/new-google-sheets-faster-more-powerful.html" target="_blank">launching a new version<span> </span></a>of its Sheets spreadsheet site today that it says is faster, more powerful, and can work offline.

Based on Hiroshi Sakurazaka's <i>All You Need Is Kill</i>, Cruise plays a soldier stuck in a time loop, where he's forced &mdash; or given the opportunity? &mdash; to fight a deadly battle over and over again. Emily Blunt (<i>Looper</i>) and Bill Paxton (<i>Aliens</i>) join him for the ride, which will hit theaters next summer.</p> <p></p> <p> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/11/5200654/tom-cruise-goes-back-to-the-future-in-the-first-trailer-for-edge-of">Continue reading&hellip;</a> </p> http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/11/5200654/tom-cruise-goes-back-to-the-future-in-the-first-trailer-for-edge-of Bryan Bishop 2013-12-11T13:25:33-05:00 2013-12-11T13:25:33-05:00 <img alt="" src="http://cdn2.sbnation.com/entry_photo_images/9547591/dec_gigapower_pricing_1_large.jpg" /> <p>Residents of Austin in eligible neighborhoods can now&nbsp;<a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="http://www.att.com/shop/u-verse/gigapower.html#fbid=ALtzofFoUpZ" target="_blank">sign up</a> for AT&amp;T's super fast fiber internet and TV service, called U-verse.

The guidance aims to phase out the use of some antibiotics that are considered "medically important" for humans. Because some of these antibiotics are widely used for promoting growth in animals &mdash; rather than directly treating infections &mdash; the FDA has shown concern that they could&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/10/31/5050624/antibiotics-in-animal-agriculture-replacements">contribute to the creation of bacteria resistant to those antibiotics</a>, making them drugs less effective in humans.</p> <p></p> <p> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/11/5200154/fda-phasing-out-medically-important-antibiotics-food-producing-animals">Continue reading&hellip;</a> </p> http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/11/5200154/fda-phasing-out-medically-important-antibiotics-food-producing-animals Jacob Kastrenakes 2013-12-11T12:35:02-05:00 2013-12-11T12:35:02-05:00 <img alt="" src="http://cdn1.sbnation.com/entry_photo_images/9546879/IMG_5451_large.jpg" /> <p>The perfect smartwatch is deceptively simple: give it a great, always-on, glanceable display.
